## I/US DMS

**I/US-DMS is a browser-based prototype of the I/US Official Sequencer.**

## What this project is

**This repository brings together two connected parts of the same idea:**

**Software prototype**  
* A browser-based sequencer used to test interface behaviour, playback workflow, sound browsing, track control, recording direction, and interaction design

**Hardware concept**  
* Early notes, layouts, schematics, and supporting documents for the future physical I/US device

The software side is the hands-on prototype you can run now.  
The hardware side shows the broader direction the project is moving toward.


## Current status

This is an early public prototype shared to organise ideas, test workflows, document progress, and gradually connect the software prototype to the larger hardware vision behind I/US.

The project is now moving beyond the earlier prototype direction and into a more complete **Revision B** architecture focused on:

* high-quality sampling
* multitrack workflow
* waveform-based DAW monitoring
* touch editing
* modular hardware
* studio-quality stereo recording


## What this repo contains

* Browser prototype (`index.html`)
* Interface experiments and sequencing workflow development
* Soundbank structure for sample testing
* Early hardware and layout notes
* Revision B block schematic and hardware planning files
* Industrial design and diagram briefing documents tied to the wider I/US system


## Features

* Multi-track sequencing
* Full piano keyboard path
* Soundfont-backed piano with fallback behaviour
* Sample library and custom sample loading
* BPM control
* Looping
* Track playback controls
* Theme / display switching where available
* Microphone-related features where supported
* Record monitor and DAW workflow experiments
* Soundbank and library workflow support


## Revision B Architecture Update

* Reframed the device from a sequencer-first prototype into a sampling-first multitrack workstation

* Kept the system as a 5-track DAW layout with a dedicated master section

* Replaced the oscilloscope-style monitor concept with a DAW-style waveform monitor direction

* Defined the monitor as a fixed shared display with vertically compressing track lanes

* Set monitor lane colors by track number:

  * Track 1 red
  * Track 2 blue
  * Track 3 white
  * Track 4 red
  * Track 5 blue

* Defined silent but engaged tracks to write as flat lines rather than disappearing

* Set the monitor to preserve recorded waveform history after capture for future edit and punch-in workflows

* Clarified that the monitor must support touch interaction for waveform selection, cursor placement, and future edit-from-position recording

* Added the requirement for visible waveform grids to support precise editing

* Added a dedicated right-side scroll / jog control for surgical waveform navigation when touch alone is not precise enough

* Split per-track recording behavior into separate functions:

  * Arm / Sample
  * Track Rec
  * Mic Rec

* Track Rec captures the track behavior/output in stereo

* Mic Rec is a separate hold-to-record sampling path

* Uploaded audio can be used as a backing-track / waveform-track source

* Added the requirement for a separate Master Mix Rec path in addition to Master Mic Rec

* Defined Master Mix Rec as the stereo capture path for all tracks and master performance output

* Confirmed that the master section remains a controller/master-bus section rather than becoming a normal track lane

* Reworked the hardware direction from a single-DSP-centered prototype into a dual-domain architecture

* Defined a Main Compute / UI subsystem for touch DAW display, themes, storage management, and HDMI output

* Defined a separate real-time audio/control subsystem for deterministic low-latency audio behavior

* Kept the audio design focused on studio-quality recording at 24-bit / 48 kHz minimum, with headroom for higher-quality operation later

* Defined the analog/digital boundary more clearly around codec, preamp, line conditioning, output stage, and digital track engine domains

* Expanded the storage direction to support multiple media paths, including more than one microSD slot and external storage workflows

* Added expanded I/O direction including additional USB-C, USB-A, and HDMI support

* Defined HDMI as an external display path for the recorder screen, sound bank monitor, and piano UI

* Rewrote the hardware plan as an open-source-ready modular board split:

  * Main Compute / UI Board
  * Real-Time Audio and Control Board
  * Audio I/O / Analog Board
  * Control Surface Board
  * Display / Touch Subsystem

* Rewrote the block schematic, hardware architecture, and layout documents around Revision B instead of the earlier Revision A prototype assumptions

* Added dedicated block-diagram and industrial-design briefing documents for future diagramming and hardware drawing work


## 14 March 2026

* Kept the app as a 5-track sequencer

* Decoupled the keyboard size from the 31-step sequencer

* Replaced the limited keyboard with a full piano keyboard

* Upgraded the keyboard path to use a soundfont-backed piano with fallback behavior

* Added a new Record Monitor below the master track

* Wired it so it shows only armed or recording tracks

* Made the monitor responsive so multiple armed tracks are visible as needed

* Added track color mapping so recordings are visually tied to their source track

* Moved the Settings inside the Library / Sound Bank monitor

* Reduced the left monitor/bank panel width by about 10%

* Added Skip Back, Play/Pause, and Skip Forward controls

* Wired the new UI so the controls and monitor behavior are connected

* Kept the master track as controller rather than using it as the recording lane

## 13 March 2026

* Added a dedicated master track panel above the regular tracks

* Included:

  * **FX toggle**
  * **Midi/Bank mode**
  * **Reverb**
  * **Delay**
  * **Distortion**
  * **Volume**
  * **Play**
  * **Rec**
  * **Sustain**

* Added a **left-side main monitor** panel

* Added an always-visible **oscilloscope** inside the main monitor

* Wired it to the **master output analyser**

* Added a persistent **Sound Library** view inside the main monitor

* Included sound browsing, file loading, search, and assignment workflow support

* Added functional **Reverb**, **Delay**, and **Distortion** controls on all tracks

* Presented the controls as physical-style knobs and wired them to audio behavior

* Added a **minimal physical EQ section** in the top area

* Wired the EQ section to the **master bus**


## How to open the prototype

* Step 1. Extract the zip file if needed.

* Step 2. Open the I/US Official Sequencer folder.

* Step 3. Open `index.html` in a modern browser.

* Step 4. The prototype will load with the main sequencer view.


## How to use the preview

* Step 1. Open `index.html` in your browser.

* Step 2. Use the main monitor and top controls to access the current workspace.

* Step 3. Open the **Library / Sound Bank** panel to browse available sounds.

* Step 4. Load audio files if you want to add custom sounds.

* Step 5. Click a sound in the library to arm or assign it for use.

* Step 6. Click a step on any track to place the selected sound into the sequence.

* Step 7. Use the track **Play** button to hear that track.

* Step 8. Use **Stop** to stop playback and reset the position as needed.

* Step 9. Change **BPM** to alter playback speed.

* Step 10. Use the **Loop** control to keep playback cycling.

* Step 11. Use the transport controls to move through playback.

* Step 12. Use the track controls to adjust playback and performance behavior.

* Step 13. Use the **Library / Sound Bank** monitor settings area for available display and sound options.

* Step 14. Use the full piano keyboard to play notes across a wider range.

* Step 15. Use the theme / display controls if available to switch viewing modes.


## Custom sounds

* Place your own sample files in the `soundbank samples` folder.

* Supported file types depend on browser audio support. Common examples include:

  * `wav`
  * `mp3`
  * `ogg`

* Custom files placed in the samples folder appear in the **Custom** category in the sound library.

* Suggested naming rules for automatic grouping:

  * Files that start with `kick`, `snare`, `clap`, or `hihat` are treated as drum sounds
  * Files that start with `bass` are treated as bass sounds
  * Files that start with `synth` are treated as synth sounds
  * Files that start with `fx` are treated as effects sounds


## Notes

* Browser audio behavior may vary slightly depending on the browser

* Some features may require user interaction before audio playback is allowed

* Microphone-related features depend on browser permissions

* Support for custom formats depends on the browser’s built-in audio decoding capabilities

* This prototype is still evolving and some areas remain experimental


## Roadmap

* Continue expanding recording and workflow features

* Continue improving hardware documentation

* Continue aligning the browser prototype with the future physical device

* Add versioned releases

* Expand plugin / effect direction over time
