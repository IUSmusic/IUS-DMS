### How to open the prototype

Step 1. Extract the zip file.
Step 2. Open the IUS Official Sequencer folder.
Step 3. Open index.html in a modern browser.
Step 4. The prototype will load with the main sequencer view.

### What the prototype does

The prototype provides a multi track step sequencer interface with 31 steps per track. It lets you open the sound library, preview sounds, assign sounds to steps, upload a default track sound, record default track audio from microphone input where supported, start and stop playback, change BPM, use looping, inspect assignments, and switch between dark and light high contrast themes.

### How to use the preview

Step 1. Open index.html in your browser.
Step 2. Click the library button in the top bar.
Step 3. Load audio files if you want to add custom sounds.
Step 4. Click a sound in the library to arm it.
Step 5. Click a step on any track to assign the armed sound.
Step 6. Use the play button on a track to hear the sequence.
Step 7. Use stop to reset the track.
Step 8. Change BPM on a track to alter playback speed.
Step 9. Use the loop control to keep playback cycling.
Step 10. Use the theme button in the top bar to switch between dark and light high contrast viewing modes.


Place your own sample files in the soundbank samples folder.
Supported file types depend on browser audio support. Common examples include wav mp3 and ogg.
Custom files placed in the samples folder appear in the custom category in the sound library.
Suggested naming rules for automatic grouping are shown below.

Files that start with kick or snare or clap or hihat are treated as drum sounds.
Files that start with bass are treated as bass sounds.
Files that start with synth are treated as synth sounds.
Files that start with fx are treated as effects sounds.
